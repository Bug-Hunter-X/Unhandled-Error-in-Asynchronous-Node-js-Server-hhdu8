# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: the lack of proper error handling within asynchronous operations.  The provided `bug.js` file showcases a server that simulates an asynchronous task.  Sometimes, this task simulates a failure, but the error is not handled gracefully, resulting in a less-than-ideal user experience or difficulties in debugging.

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling, ensuring that errors are caught and reported appropriately, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the server.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Make multiple requests to `http://localhost:3000` to observe inconsistent responses.
5. Then run `node bugSolution.js`, and observe consistent and informative error handling.
